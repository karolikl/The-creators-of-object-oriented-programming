## The pioneer era in Norwegian scientific computing (1948-1962)

FFI ordered a Mercury machine named FREDERIC from Ferranti Ltd in 1954. One of the biggest at the time. 

"*Few programming tools followed FREDERIC from the supplier and the users became impatient. Among them was Kristen Nygaard who from 1956 was head of a group for operational research. A very active programming group developed at FFI included Svein A. Øvergaard who later became the leader of the next computing centre at Kjeller, and Ole Johan Dahl who developed the language MAC based on Algol. He made an efficient compiler for MAC.*" Page 27 

"*By 1959-1960, NTNF was worried because NCC had developed into just a commercial computing centre. The scientific community had lost their centre, a place for requesting support and getting access to modern technology. Therefore, they asked Kristen Nygaard at FFI to come to NCC to build up a research group in operational research there. In May 1960, he left FFI and that summer four other members of his group followed. They did not was to be involved in punched card calculators or DEUCE. Therefore, they kept on using FREDERIC while they were looking for other possibilities. In the spring on 1961, the ideas for a language that could serve the dual purpose of system description and simulation programming originated at NCC.*" Page 29

"*NCC gave a full year course on "programming, system analysis, and quantitative methods" from 1962 and they have short programming courses in Algol as the lack of skilled programmers was severe.*" Page 30

"*In March 1962, NCC also had entered into an agreement with Regnecentralen in Copenhagen for obtaining a GIER. [...] However, the scientists at NCC working on large simulation models felt they needed even more computer power. The possibility for this materialized when in May 1962 Kristen Nygaard was invited to the USA on an "executive tour" by UNIVAC and he was told about the new UNIVAC 1107. On this tour UNIVAC became interested in the Simula language that Kristen Nygaard and Ole Johan Dahl were defining [...]. In June, NCC received a half price offer from UNIVAC. Included in the deal was the delivery of a Simula compiler and a LP package. [...] When it arrived in August of 1963, the UNIVAC 1107 was the largest and most modern civil computer installation in Europe. WIth this very strong tool and a surplus of capacity, a new era for NCC and Norwegian computing started, including the development of Simula and object-oriented programming.*"

## Research and curricula development at Norwegian universities

"*At the University of Oslo, the first professor was Ole Johan Dahl. In 1968 he moved to the University from the Norwegian Computing Center (Norsk Regnesentral) where he had been inventing the first object oriented programming language Simula together with Kristen Nygaars. For this, they shared the John von Neumann medal in 2002 and the A.M. Turing award in 2001. [...] Dahl's work on programming and compiler technology was very influential in forming the scientific profile of the curriculum, and on teaching of computer science as a whole in Norway.*" Page 138

"*One might think that the inventors of object orientation, Ole Johan Dahl and Kristen Nygaard would continue their research in that direction, but only partly so. First, the term "object orientation" did not yet exist and secondly, they thought Simula was only one among many new promising programming languages at that time. Dahl was however eager to demonstrate to his students the ability of the class concept to model lists, trees and graphs. He also organized graduate courses in discrete simulation using Simula. However, only after Allen Kay had designed Smalltalk (heavily influenced by Simula) did the term "object-orientation" appear. Ole-Johan Dahl, after having successfully assisted the implementation on Simula on the CDC 33000, and introduced Simula into his courses, went on to formal specification and verification of programs, which he by and large continued with for the rest of his life. The proof system Abel and the book "Verifiable programmin" are here the main results. Kristen Nygaard designed two new languages, Delta for the specification of systems (not machine compilable) and Beta, intended to be a more well structures, clean, orthogonal, object oriented language.*" Page 146.
