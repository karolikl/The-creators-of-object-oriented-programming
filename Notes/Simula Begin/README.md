## Systems and models ##

"*A computer's processing unit executes instructions sequentially, one at a time. This implies that SIMULA used as a programming langugae will have to describe the actions occuring in a system as a strictly serial sequence. One action will have to be completed before the next is started.*" Page 19.

"*When parallel actions are to be described, SIMULA must the augmented by the use of informal language. System descriptions written in SIMULA may be presented as programs to a computer when only formal language is used.*" Page 20.

## Basic concepts of SIMULA ##

"*An object in general consists of three parts:*

- *A heading identifying the kind of object*
- *A data structure*
- *An action sequence*

Page 26

"*The operator ":=" implies "becomes" in the sense of "make equal", in contrast to the "is equal" ("=") known in matematics.* Page 32

"*The mode of object construction developed makes all CUSTOMER-objects similar in the sense of having:* 

- *the same fixed heading*
- *the same fixed layout of variables*
- *the same fixed action pattern.*

*However, the CUSTOMER-objects are different in the sense of having:*

- *individual existence as distinct objects*
- *individual values associated with their variables*
- *an individual LSC indicating each object's state of execution*"
